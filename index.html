      <h2>Welcome!</h2>

        In this data visualization, I explore the relationship between overall
        government expenditure and education and crime rates. While government
        spending is not specifically focused on these areas, I aim to provide
        insight into the potential impact of overall government spending on
        education and crime rates. The comprehensive data set includes
        information from the Sustainable Development Goal indicators compiled by
        the United Nations, academic surveys, and international financial
        institutions. This data visualization is a useful tool for policymakers,
        researchers, and anyone interested in understanding the potential impact
        of overall government spending on education and crime rates.

      <h2>The Variables Explained</h2>
      <div class="text-container">
        <div class="text-box">
          <h3>Crime index</h3>
          <p>
            The Crime Index is an estimation of the overall level of crime in a
            given country, based on surveys. The surveys use a range of values
            from -2 to +2, which are then filtered to eliminate potential spam,
            and presented on a scale of 0 to 100. The index is updated using
            data up to 36 months old and is remade twice per year. The Safety
            Index is the opposite of the Crime Index, with a high Safety Index
            indicating a very safe city. The actual formulas used to calculate
            the indices are subject to change, but at present, complex empirical
            formulas can be found <a

          <h3>Country Expenses (% of GDP)</h3>
          <p>
            As defined in the source "Expense is cash payments for operating
            activities of the government in providing goods and services. It
            includes compensation of employees (such as wages and salaries),
            interest and subsidies, grants, social benefits, and other expenses
            such as rent and dividends." This information is taken from the
            World Development Indicators
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box">
          <h3>"Educational attainment, at least Bachelor's or equivalent</h3>
          <p>
            To determine the indicator, the percentage of individuals aged 25
            and older who have completed a Bachelor's degree or an equivalent
            qualification is calculated. This is achieved by dividing the number
            of people who meet this criterion by the total population of that
            age group, then multiplying the result by 100. If the resulting
            value is zero or so small that it would round to zero, the number 0
            is used instead. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics is responsible
            for collecting the data, which is primarily sourced from national
            population censuses, household surveys, and labor force surveys.

        This Correlogram is a graphical and numeric representation of
        the Pearson correlation. This coefficient is a measure of the linear
        correlation between the variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where -1
        indicates a perfect negative correlation, 0 indicates no
        correlation, and 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation.

        These interactive scatter plots provide insights into the relationships
        between expenses, education index, and crime index for the countries in
        the dataset. By brushing a region on one chart, you can observe the
        highlighted points on both charts to explore patterns and correlations.
        <br>
        <br>
Select a region on the education-expense chart to highlight the countries within
the region and their corresponding points on the crime-expense chart. Similarly,
selecting a region on the crime-expense chart will highlight the countries
within the region and their corresponding points on the education-expense chart.

Examine the distribution of data points to identify trends, correlations, and
unique patterns. Utilize this information to inform decision-making or further

        Contour lines represent areas with the same density or frequency of data
        points, forming a topographical representation of the data. The crime
        weight is used to determine the density or frequency of the points, with
        higher crime weights contributing to a higher density in the
        corresponding area on the graph.
<br>
<br>

        When creating a contour density graph using D3, you can
        manipulate two important parameters: bandwidth and threshold. These
        parameters can be adjusted using sliders for a more interactive
        experience.
        <br><br>

        Bandwidth: This parameter controls the smoothness of the density
        estimation. A smaller bandwidth will result in a more detailed and
        "noisy" graph, with closely spaced contour lines, while a larger
        bandwidth will produce a smoother and more generalized representation of
        the data with wider spaced contour lines. Adjusting the bandwidth slider
        allows you to explore different levels of detail in the density
        estimation.
        <br><br>

        Threshold: This parameter determines the number of contour levels or
        lines to display in the graph. A lower threshold value will result in
        more contour lines, representing smaller density intervals, while a
        higher threshold value will reduce the number of contour lines,
        representing larger density intervals. Adjusting the threshold slider
        helps you focus on specific density ranges and filter out less
        significant areas.
        <br><br>

        Contour density graphs are particularly useful for understanding complex
        relationships and patterns in data. They can reveal trends,
        correlations, and outliers, as well as help identify areas of high or
        low concentration. In the case of the expense-education-crime graph, a
        contour density graph can show how crime rates vary across different
        combinations of expense and education levels, revealing insights that
        might not be immediately apparent in a table or scatterplot.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <center><p>
      Upon close examination of the available data, it can be inferred that although
  there seems to be a slight correlation between government spending, education,
  and crime rates, it is not possible to establish a clear and unequivocal
  relationship among these variables. While it is tempting to draw conclusions
  based on the available evidence, it is important to note that other factors
  may be at play that are not captured by the current visualization. 
  <br><br>
  There are several potential confounding variables that could be affecting the
  observed relationship between government spending, education, and crime rates.
  For example, socio-economic status, cultural factors, and demographic
  characteristics of the population could all have an impact on these variables.
  In addition, the quality and accessibility of social services, such as
  healthcare and housing, may also be significant factors that affect crime
  rates.
  <br><br>
  Therefore, it is critical to recognize the potential influence of these
  extraneous factors and undertake more extensive research to examine their
  impact on the relationship between government spending, education, and crime
  rates. By delving into these additional factors and accounting for their
  effects, it will be possible to gain a more complete understanding of the
  complex relationships between these variables and to develop more effective
  policies and strategies to address issues related to crime rates, education,
  and government spending.
