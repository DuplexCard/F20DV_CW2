      <h2>Welcome!</h2>

        In this data visualization, I explore the relationship between overall
        government expenditure and education and crime rates. While government
        spending is not specifically focused on these areas, I aim to provide
        insight into the potential impact of overall government spending on
        education and crime rates. The comprehensive data set includes
        information from the Sustainable Development Goal indicators compiled by
        the United Nations, academic surveys, and international financial
        institutions. This data visualization is a useful tool for policymakers,
        researchers, and anyone interested in understanding the potential impact
        of overall government spending on education and crime rates.

      <h2>The Variables Explained</h2>
      <div class="text-container">
        <div class="text-box">
          <h3>Crime index</h3>
          <p>
            The Crime Index is an estimation of the overall level of crime in a
            given country, based on surveys. The surveys use a range of values
            from -2 to +2, which are then filtered to eliminate potential spam,
            and presented on a scale of 0 to 100. The index is updated using
            data up to 36 months old and is remade twice per year. The Safety
            Index is the opposite of the Crime Index, with a high Safety Index
            indicating a very safe city. The actual formulas used to calculate
            the indices are subject to change, but at present, complex empirical
            formulas can be found <a

          <h3>Country Expenses (% of GDP)</h3>
          <p>
            As defined in the source "Expense is cash payments for operating
            activities of the government in providing goods and services. It
            includes compensation of employees (such as wages and salaries),
            interest and subsidies, grants, social benefits, and other expenses
            such as rent and dividends." This information is taken from the
            World Development Indicators
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box">
          <h3>"Educational attainment, at least Bachelor's or equivalent</h3>
          <p>
            To determine the indicator, the percentage of individuals aged 25
            and older who have completed a Bachelor's degree or an equivalent
            qualification is calculated. This is achieved by dividing the number
            of people who meet this criterion by the total population of that
            age group, then multiplying the result by 100. If the resulting
            value is zero or so small that it would round to zero, the number 0
            is used instead. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics is responsible
            for collecting the data, which is primarily sourced from national
            population censuses, household surveys, and labor force surveys.

        This Correlogram is a graphical and numeric representation of the
        The Pearson correlation. This coefficient is a measure of the linear
        correlation between the variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where -1
        indicates a perfect negative correlation, 0 indicates no
        correlation, and 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation.

        These interactive scatter plots provide insights into the relationships
        between expenses, education index, and crime index for the countries in
        the dataset. By brushing a region on one chart, you can observe the
        highlighted points on both charts to explore patterns and correlations.
        <br>
        <br>
Select a region on the education-expense chart to highlight the countries within
the region and their corresponding points on the crime-expense chart. Similarly,
selecting a region on the crime-expense chart will highlight the countries
within the region and their corresponding points on the education-expense chart.

Examine the distribution of data points to identify trends, correlations, and
unique patterns. Utilize this information to inform decision-making or further
analysis.
